![me]({{site.baseurl}}/images/myFace3.jpeg){: style="float: left; margin-right: 1em;"}  _Hi, welcome!_ I am a graduate student in the [Neuroscience Program at Emory University](http://biomed.emory.edu/PROGRAM_SITES/NS/) and the [Marcus Autism Center](https://www.marcus.org/), where I work with Dr. Sarah Shultz in the [Pediatric Neuroimaging Lab](https://www.marcus.org/autism-research/autism-research-labs/pediatric-neuroimaging). 
I spent my early childhood in Alaska and then moved to Connecticut, where I also completed my undergraduate degree (go Huskies!). Continually adding to my cross-country trek, I've now made my way to Atlanta, Georgia.
 
Broadly, my graduate research asks how early social experiences shape brain maturation, with an emphasis on the first year of life. Both developmental and clinical research questions motivate me: I study the mechanisms by which modifiable factors, like social experience, contribute to individual neurobehavioral variability to inform our understanding of the etiology of autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders. In pursuing this research, first as a post-baccalaureate research fellow and now a graduate student, I pair novel computational methods with longitudinal curve-fitting analyses to map dynamic processes in social neurodevelopment.
