<h4 id="hebb-human-early-brain-behavior"><strong>HEBB: Human Early Brain-Behavior</strong></h4>

<p>How does attention to the eyes of others contribute to the maturation of major white matter tracts in the infant brain? 
As the eponymous Donald Hebb coined, ‚ÄúCells that fire together, wire together.‚Äù The first 6 months mark the window of 
greatest postnatal brain growth and experience-dependent plasticity, with the rate of neurogenesis slowing just as synaptogenesis picks up. 
In this study we are using longitudinal eye-tracking and diffusion tensor imaging, collected from the same infants, 
to explore the reciprocal and iterative relationship between early social experience and brain development.</p>

<h4 id="mebb-macaque-early-brain-behavior"><strong>MEBB: Macaque Early Brain-Behavior</strong></h4>

<p>How does attention to the eyes of others contribute to the development of functional brain networks 
in non-human primate models of social development?  This study parallels the HEBB analysis with a cohort of 
infant rhesus macaques. Macaques are a remarkable animal model of early development because they live in dynamic 
social communities.</p>

Attention to the eyes is related to maturation of the visual object pathway in infant rhesus macaques. (in prep)</p>

<h4 id="cidd-caregiver-infant-dyad-dynamics"><strong>CIDD: Caregiver-Infant Dyad Dynamics</strong></h4>

<p>What do infants and caregivers do during social interactions from birth to six months, 
and how are their behaviors temporally and contextually dependent on those of their social partner? 
What can that information tell us about the progression of autism spectrum disorder? To answer these questions, 
I am leveraging advances in computer vision and machine learning for dynamic behavior prediction to measure, 
in a data-driven approach, what infants and caregivers do during dyadic social interactions and how their behaviors influence each other.</p>
